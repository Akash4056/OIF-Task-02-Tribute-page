            <h5 id="third-div-text">Steve Jobs was an American entrepreneur, inventor, and co-founder of Apple Inc. He
                was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California. From an early age, Jobs showed an interest
                in electronics, and he quickly became fascinated with computers.
                <br><br>
                In 1976, Jobs and his friend Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple Computer, Inc. in the Jobs family garage.
                The company began by producing computer kits for hobbyists, but quickly expanded to produce complete
                computers. Under Jobs' leadership, Apple became a major player in the computer industry, introducing the
                Macintosh in 1984 and revolutionizing the personal computer industry.
                <br><br>
                However, Jobs left Apple in 1985 after a power struggle with the company's board of directors. He went
                on to found NeXT Computer, Inc. and became involved in the creation of the Pixar animation studio. Jobs
                returned to Apple in 1997, when the company was struggling, and turned it into one of the most
                successful technology companies in the world.
                <br><br>
                Throughout his life, Jobs was known for his passion for design, his uncompromising standards, and his
                ability to inspire and motivate his employees. He died on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56, but his
                legacy continues to inspire entrepreneurs and innovators around the world.
